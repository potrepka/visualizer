# Visualizer

A collection of 99 Three.js scenes that test the limits of state-of-the-art language models. Each scene is a single React Three Fiber component generated entirely by an LLM in one shot, with no human edits to the scene code.

The most recent batch was generated with Claude Opus 4.6 in Claude Code.

## Setup

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Controls
